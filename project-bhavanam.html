                     <p>Bhavanam is a CSR initiative by BPCL Kochi Refinery to provide eco-friendly and safe cooking stoves to underprivileged families. This project involved designing a donation app to facilitate contributions, ensuring a transparent, engaging, and easy-to-use platform for donors who want to make a tangible difference in empowering rural women and promoting healthier communities.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">The Problem</h3>
                     <p>The existing manual donation process for social causes often suffers from inefficiency, a lack of transparency, limited reach, and poor donor engagement. Donors are disconnected from the impact of their contributions and are hesitant to give due to a lack of trust and a complicated process.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">My Role</h3>
                     <p>As the lead UX/UI designer, my responsibility was to design the entire mobile app experience from the ground up. This included conducting user research to understand donor motivations, creating the design system, mapping out user flows, and crafting high-fidelity wireframes and UI screens for development.</p>

                     <div class="space-y-8">
                         <p><strong>User Research:</strong> I conducted interviews with potential donors to understand their needs and pain points. Key insights revealed that donors desire transparency above all, want a simple and quick donation process, appreciate regular updates on the impact of their contribution, and want to feel emotionally connected to the cause.</p>

                         <p><strong>Design System:</strong> A clean and trust-inspiring design system was developed, using a color palette of blues and greens to evoke a sense of calm, trust, and environmental consciousness. The typography was chosen for its clarity and readability on mobile screens.</p>

                         <p><strong>Prototyping & UI:</strong> I created high-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes in Figma, focusing on a streamlined donation flow. The final UI was designed to be clean, intuitive, and emotionally resonant, with clear calls-to-action and visuals that highlight the impact of each donation.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">Takeaways & Learnings</h3>
                     <p>This project reinforced the importance of user-centered design in the social impact space. By focusing on transparency and emotional connection, we could design an experience that not only facilitates donations but also builds a community of engaged supporters. A key learning was that simplifying the donation process to just a few taps significantly lowers the barrier for users to contribute, leading to greater impact for the cause.</p>
