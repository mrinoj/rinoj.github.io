                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">The Problem</h3>
                     <p>The Travacations B2B platform, a critical tool for travel agents, was underperforming. Key metrics revealed a sinking ship: user engagement had plummeted by 40%, and a staggering 60% of booking attempts were being abandoned mid-process. The core issue was a convoluted, 12-step booking workflow that was unintuitive and time-consuming, causing significant friction and frustration for its power users.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">My Role</h3>
                     <p>As the Lead UX Designer, I was responsible for the end-to-end redesign. This involved spearheading the user research, defining the new user flow and information architecture, creating wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes, and conducting usability testing with key stakeholders.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">The Process</h3>
                     <div class="space-y-8">
                         <p><strong>Discovery & Research:</strong> The first step was to understand the "why" behind the data. I conducted in-depth interviews with 15 travel agents. The key insight was that agents weren't booking linearly; they were constantly juggling multiple client itineraries, comparing options, and needing to quickly jump between tasks. The existing system wasn't built for this multi-threaded workflow.</p>
                         <p><strong>Ideation:</strong> Armed with these insights, I sketched out new user flows that prioritized a non-linear, dashboard-centric approach. This allowed agents to manage multiple bookings from a central hub. Low-fidelity wireframes were created in Figma to quickly validate these new concepts with our user group.</p>

                         <p><strong>Design & Prototyping:</strong> I developed a clean, modern design system to bring consistency to the UI. The high-fidelity prototypes focused on clarity and efficiency, with a task-based layout that mirrored the agents' mental models. We prioritized clear visual hierarchy and reduced cognitive load at every step.</p>
                         <p><strong>Testing & Iteration:</strong> We conducted five moderated usability tests with agents using the Figma prototype. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, but it also revealed a key area for improvement: the initial dashboard felt too cluttered. Based on this, I iterated on the design, introducing a more streamlined card-based system that tested much better in a second round of testing.</p>

                     <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">The Outcome & Impact</h3>
                     <p>The redesigned platform was a resounding success. By streamlining the booking process from 12 steps down to just 4, we achieved a 70% reduction in the average time to book. This efficiency gain led to a 90% increase in agent satisfaction and, crucially, an 80% drop in booking abandonment. This directly translated to a 25% increase in completed bookings within the first quarter of launch.</p>
