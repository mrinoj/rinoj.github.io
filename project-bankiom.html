                    <p>The client's vision was a revolutionary fintech "super-app" combining budgeting, investments, and AI-powered financial advice. The central UX challenge was immense: how to unify these complex, data-heavy services into a single, cohesive experience that felt simple, empowering, and trustworthy to the average user, who is often intimidated by financial management tools.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">My Role</h3>
                    <p>As the lead product designer, I was tasked with architecting the complete user journey. My responsibilities included developing a comprehensive design system, leading user journey mapping workshops, and working closely with the data science team to design an intuitive interface for the AI-driven features.</p>

                    <div class="space-y-8">
                        <p><strong>Discovery & Research:</strong> We began with extensive market research and user interviews with 20 individuals from diverse financial backgrounds. A key insight was the "trust gap"â€”users were skeptical of AI making financial recommendations. They wanted transparency and control.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ideation:</strong> I facilitated journey mapping workshops to chart out every potential user path, from onboarding to making a first investment. For the AI feature, we sketched multiple concepts for presenting financial advice, focusing on clarity and "explainability" to build trust.</p>

                        <p><strong>Design & Prototyping:</strong> A modular design system was crucial for consistency. We used a clean, card-based UI with clear data visualizations to make complex information digestible. I designed the AI interface to provide recommendations with clear reasoning and sliders for users to adjust risk levels, giving them a sense of control.</p>

                        <p><strong>Testing & Iteration:</strong> We ran A/B tests on the AI recommendation feature. Version A was direct ("You should invest in X"). Version B was more conversational and explanatory ("Based on your goals, here are a few options, and here's why..."). Version B overwhelmingly won, increasing user trust and engagement with the feature by 40%.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">The Outcome & Impact</h3>
                    <p>The focus on building trust and providing a seamless experience paid off. The app achieved a 35% increase in user retention within six months and was featured on several major tech blogs for its innovative, user-centric approach. We successfully turned a complex suite of tools into a beloved daily financial companion for thousands of users.</p>
